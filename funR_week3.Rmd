# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown documents let you combine text, code, and output into a single document. You can add lots of other formatting touches as well. These documents can be outputted as HTML, pdf, or Word documents. To learn more, see the [official R Markdown page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) or this [free online book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).


## Code Chunks

Code chunks are put between two sets of three tick marks (with a note in curly brackets about what type of code it is). When you *knit* a document, it runs all of the code and produces a document including text, code, and output.

Replace the line starting with **mystery** with a line that reads the mystery dataset into R. To do this, you should have the .csv file in the same folder as your 

```{r cars}
library(readr)
mystery <- data.frame(t = NA, x = NA, y = NA, message = NA)
```

You can run individual code chunks using the green triangle button or run everything at once using the Knit button.


### Output

So far our code hasn't produced any output. What about when we run the code below?

```{r}
head(mystery, n = 5)
summary(mystery)
```

It's hard to tell what's going on in our data. Let's make a graph.


### Graphs

We haven't learned how to create graphs yet in class, but I've added some code below that produces one. So far it's not showing up in the document though. That's because I used the `eval = FALSE` option in the curly brackets to tell R not to run this code. Try changing it to say `eval = TRUE`.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(mystery$x, mystery$y, type = 'l', col = 'red', lwd = 5)
text(0, 0, paste0(na.omit(mystery$message), collapse = ""), 
     col = "white", cex = 1.5)
```

Try changing `eval = TRUE` to `echo = FALSE`. Then knit the document. How does the output change?

`echo = FALSE` makes it so... **Put your answer here**

`eval = FALSE` makes it so... **Answer this too**
